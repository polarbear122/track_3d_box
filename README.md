# SimpleTrack: Simple yet Effective 3D Multi-object Tracking

This is the repository for our paper [SimpleTrack: Understanding and Rethinking 3D Multi-object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09621). We are still working on writing the documentations and cleaning up the code. However, we have already moved all of our code onto the `dev` branch, so please feel free to check it out if you really need to delve deep recently. We will try our best to get everything ready as soon as possible.

## Installation

### Environment Requirements

`SimpleTrack` requires `python>=3.6` and the packages of `pip install -r requiremens.txt`. For the experiments on Waymo Open Dataset, please install the devkit following the instructions at [waymo open dataset devkit](https://github.com/waymo-research/waymo-open-dataset).

### Installation

We implement the `SimpleTrack` algorithm as a library `mot_3d`. Please run `pip install -e ./` to install it locally.

## Demo and API Example

## Inference on Waymo Open Dataset and nuScenes

Refer to the documentation of [Waymo Open Dataset Inference](./docs/waymo.md) and [nuScenes Inference](./docs/nuScenes.md).

The detailed metrics on Waymo Open Dataset is at, nuScenes is at.

For the metrics on test set, please refer to our paper or the leaderboard.
